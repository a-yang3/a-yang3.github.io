    <p>While there are other similar venue search engines, Wedding Spot is unique because it offers a very detailed and highly accurate price estimate tool for people who want a quick quote on a specific venue. </p>

    <p>For this project, we wanted to improve the experience of venue searching by designing an onboarding flow and rethinking Wedding-Spot's Spot Estimate tool. While we worked collaboratively in a team of 3 other student designers from different disciplines with the head of product at Honeybook, I led the user research sprint and designed for the Spot Estimate tool.
      <p>This project was completed in fall of 2017, and it's incredibly exciting to see the site now updated with a few recommendations we explored during our design process (accordian style spot estimate and onboarding chatbot).

<!-- end divider + title -->

<!-- start focus text -->

<h1 style="width: 50%;">
Planning a wedding can be incredibly stressful. Current tools can be confusing for people who are just starting to look for wedding venues because they feel unfamiliar with the process.

    <p>
The search for wedding venues is a daunting process, and especially for newly engaged couples, completing long questionnaires for tools like WS's Spot Estimate can be frustrating. From HoneyBook's previous user tests with the current Wedding-Spot site, we learned that couples are anxious and overwhelmed by the process. There was no existing method of getting the user familiarized with the process. </p>

<p>Additionally, for users who have little to no information about their preferences yet (which is the case for most casual browsers), there is no motivation to fill out the Spot Estimate. There was a drop off rate in the user search journey. We hypothesized that the lack of an onboarding system contributed to user frustration.</p>

    <p>After synthesizing past usability tests and discussing with our client, we came up with the following problem statements to narrow down the scope of our project and better understand our target users: </p>

    <p>1. How might we educate the user on how to use WS to reduce negative feelings associated with venue searching?
</p>
<p>2. How might we present and receive the most important information to and from the user to make an accurate estimate?</p>

<h1 style="width: 50%;">
Working with Berkeley Innovation and HoneyBook was my first professional, non-hackathon experience with product design. I learned so much about the human-centered design pipeline and e-commerce platforms. Here were my personal key takeaways from this project:

1. For user research, we only collected ~26 survey responses. Our insights would look very different with a larger sample size, and could potentially change our design goals with the onboarding process. </p>

        <p>
2. For user testing, we only conducted 4 sessions (wanted specifically ‘freshly’ engaged couples). There were general trends, but it was difficult to understand what the best option was because each participant reacted very differently. 
</p>

<p>3. There will always, always, always be tradeoffs between business goals and design goals, and it is my responsibility to argue for that balance to the best of my ability.</p>

<p>
4. Everyone has different styles of leadership, and scheduling issues sometimes result in meeting at 10 PM on a Thursday night (also, late night meetings are objectively better when motivated with candy and snacks 😀).</p>
