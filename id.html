I worked with a team of 3 other student designers on a project for <span class="link"><a href="https://medium.com/jacobs-institute-for-design-innovation/reimagining-mobility-8030ae2974ba">DES INV 190-1: REIMAGINING MOBILITY</a></span>, a design course offered through the Jacobs Hall of Design Innovation.

    <p>The class began with a pretty open-ended prompt: how might we reimagine mobility? As a joint effort between Jacobs Hall and Ford Motors, the goal of the class was to encourage innovative solutions in the transportation space and launch a campaign proposal at the end of the semester. We were mentored by great instructors and got critiqued each week. </p>

    <p>As a team, we were all interested in the intersection of transportation and accessibility. We started by thinking of accessibility issues in current public transit spaces, and discovered there was a huge lack of solutions for people with invisible disabilities. Through this class, we wanted to pursue the opportunity to learn more about and raise awareness of the commuting experience for individuals with invisible disabilities.</p>

    <p>The intent of this project was not to "solve invisibility disability problems" in any capacity — this would be inappropriate to approach from a design perspective because the nature of problems faced by those with invisible disabilities is incredibly complex. Rather, this project reflects our team's design concepts specific to public transit spaces based on the stories we learned about. Our goal is to continue sharing these stories and educating communities about designing with accessibility in mind.

<h1 style="width: 50%;">
Individuals with invisible disabilities are often misunderstood, especially in public transit spaces. A majority of commuters make assumptions about disabilities that have no physical markers.

Invisible disabilities refer to disabilities that aren’t immediately apparent, and can range from physical ailments like chronic pain and vision problems, to psychiatric conditions like brain injury and PTSD. Individuals with invisible disabilities can look ‘normal’ and healthy on the outside, causing their needs to be often overlooked, especially on public transportation.</p>

Our intention with the survey was to understand the spectrum of invisible disabilities that exist and their corresponding needs, as well as how individuals with invisible disabilities experienced public transportation. </p>

        <p>
We reached out to DSP centers on campus, invisible disability groups on Facebook, and friends within our personal networks — however, the community we got the most responses from was Reddit! HUGE shout out to the amazing folks on those subreddits who were incredibly open to sharing their stories and helping us learn so much.</p>

This helped us have a more natural and candid conversation about how having an invisible disability affects everyday life, with a focus on mobility and transportation accessibility. 
</p>

        <p>This was one of the most eye-opening and gratifying parts of the project because we realized how much we didn't know about invisible disabilities; moreover, many individuals echoed the sentiment that lack of awareness negatively impacts their everyday life, especially around getting a seat on public transportation. </p>

Social lives of individuals with invisible disabilities are heavily affected, and many end up staying home because transportation is troublesome and anxiety inducing. In some cases, it can lead to homelessness and loss of jobs. </p>

There exist common misconceptions about invisible disabilities because people assume disabilities are only physical, young people are seldom disabled, etc. Many individuals look able-bodied and face judgement due to a lack of awareness of their condition, and wish it wasn’t taboo to talk about in public.

The feasible and validated opportunities to explore were an awareness campaign, ally system and logo redesign. In our low fidelity sketching, we decided to tackle the logo redesign because a pressing issue with the current public transportation signage is how it only represents the disabled with stick figures that are pregnant, use canes, or sit in wheelchairs.</p>
<p>Our goal was to communicate a helping hand to foster the allyship that able-bodied folks can have with individuals who identify as having an invisible disability. We also explored using the eye icon to make it clear that not all ailments have recognizable physical markers.

1. It's crucial to keep people's needs at the center design ideation, but it's also important to refine the problem scope enough because not every single type of ailment can be addressed in a public-facing solution.</p>

        <p>
2. Talking to users and getting their input is absolutely crucial at every step of the process. Naming, copy and graphic design for this project were largely led by the feedback we received, and we could have done with getting more people to give critique.
</p>

<p>3. It's ok to pivot towards a better solution (even when there's only a few weeks left :~0), and continue to get feedback on updated iterations.</p>
