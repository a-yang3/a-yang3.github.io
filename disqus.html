Disqus users include publishers who see thousands of comments per day. Currently, publishers either use third party moderation services or employ dedicated moderators volunteer their time sifting through individual comments. </p>

<p>Improving moderation tools helps add value to the publisher experience and improve publisher retention on our software as a service (SaaS) plans. </p>

<p>Additionally, there were troves of existing research dedicated to understanding toxicity and moderation across Disqus sites, along with feedback from the first release of Moderation Rules, a set of tools that help users automate moderation.</p>

<p>Navigating moderation for online communities is a complex process, often complicated by political stances and dedication to community values, which is why I focused a large chunk of my time carefully going through existing research.</p>

<p>

My goals for this portion of the project were to understand moderation use cases and behavior, and identify the specific needs for our target users (which would later be defined post-research). </p>

   <h3>Current UX</h3><p>
I annotated the current flow for creating moderation rules, which helped me understand what is/isn’t working within the interface.</p>

   <h3>Team constraints</h3><p>
  
I met with some team members who were a part of the first iteration team to understand the product thinking and implementation constraints that were considered internally.</p>

 <h3>Competitive analysis</h3><p>
  
I considered platforms that use advanced filter or search interfaces to understand UI across different industries. I also looked at platforms that host discussions (Wordpress, Youtube, Reddit) to understand moderation behavior among online communities.</p>

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<p>1. Spam commenters rapidly create new accounts to continue posting spam/harassment in order to avoid ban consequence, and there are no filters that factor account age.</p>

<p>2. Issuing timeouts can only be done manually, and on a case-by-case basis. Publishers worry about non-spam comments ending up in a long pending queue for moderation.</p>

<p>3. The current UI does not allow for complex, context-aware rules and that is an impediment for trust in auto-moderation.</p>

<h3>Definition of Target Users</h3>
<p>Much of the iteration feedback and existing research came from users who were either part of the publisher council or medium to heavy moderation users, so the ideation for this project was narrowed down to suit their needs. More specifically: </p>


<p>1. Members of the publisher council<br>
Active feedback, familiar with Moderation Rules.</p>

<p>2. SaaS plan subscribers<br>
Advanced moderation tools are most available for Pro and Business plan publishers</p>

<p>3. Publishers with at least 30 moderation actions weekly<br>
Users who frequently experience moderation burden

Because we were limited by our team size and other technical constraints, I focused my efforts on redesigning just the Moderation Rules interface, although there are many other touchpoints moderators and publishers interact with in administrator features. <br><br>With the contraints in mind, I moved forward with use cases that typically require context-specific moderation.

  Considering the amount of research that had already been invested in the project, it made the most sense to build off the feedback we had earlier and focus primarily on the rule creation interface. Other opportunities in the problem space weren’t supported by enough research to pursue (i.e. can’t confirm that onboarding is ineffective, color coding actions might be misleading, etc).</p>

     <h3>
  Use cases for publisher needs I tried to address in the first pass:</h3>
  <p>1. Users who rapidly create new accounts to continue posting spam/harassment (take account age into consideration)</p>

  <p>2. Users who end up in long list of pending comments.
</p>

<p>3. Users whose comments do not warrant permanent banning, but pose problems for repeat moderation actions.

My PM and I met to review the rule flows and interface designs. Here were some of the considerations we made to narrow down options:

  <div class="text-block"> 
  <h3>1. Allow for more complex rules by assigning actions to multiple filters and conditions. </h3><p>
This meant expanding the drop down selections and thinking of ways to present options without restraining the user. We also had to balance this with providing users with the right set up options based on data analysis, because it would be inefficient to develop filter options that won't get used.</p>

   <h3>2. Maintain the consistency of the current “If … then” structure. </h3><p>
  In past usability sessions, publishers often described their use cases in natural language that fits the "If … then" structure; additionally, it was easier for the backend to implement with this format.</p>

 <h3>3. Not all publishers were familiar with advanced logic.
</h3><p>
  
The interface should be as flexible as possible without taking away from basic rule creation. Even though the project scope was narrowed down to more technical use cases, it should be usable on a spectrum of abilities.

  <h3>1. Advanced logic </h3><p>
Our goal was to make rows easy to add and remove in order to allow access to more advanced rules without taking away from writing basic rules. We learned from research that too many options might be overwhelming and lead to moderator choice paralysis.</p>

   <h3>2. Additional drop down options 
</h3><p>
  We have previous analysis to infer which options will be most used by publishers. In using validated research, it helps us predict adoptability. For example, 7 days is a popular timeout duration. </p>

 <h3>3. Conditional rules

</h3><p>
We needed to ommunicate active/inactive drop down options, so users follow can write rules that are actually feasible. This also helps the backend handle conditional drop downs such that new rules have no logical interference.

In the future, I will show work earlier, and more often, as well as seek more mentorship from the non-product team (i.e. analytics, marketing etc). If I were to do this project again, I would conduct more preliminary research with our target publishers to better validate our design decisions.</p>

        <p>
The team for this summer was small, and I had many unique opportunities as the only designer at Disqus during my time there. I got to help facilitate onsite interviews for full-time product designers, lead a research meeting to share my findings, sync with people across different teams and roles, and meet with my design mentors outside of work. I’m excited to see what products the team develops next!
